# TRUTH (or Veritas)

TRUTH is a client-side software, which provides a secure and private chat environment, as well as the persistent chat data query.

When people shop online more and more often, even buying foreign goods, or signing a remote labor contract with a foreign company, it is inevitable to communicate online. The preservation of chat records becomes even more important.
We hope that the chat history will not be modified and deleted, and we can confirm the time of each record and the identity of both parties.

# How to use

You need have [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) installed.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
